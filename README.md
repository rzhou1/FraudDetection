# Fraud detection: Exploring feature extraction for predicting fraudulent activity of the first transaction of a new user.

This repo exemplifies feature extraction from raw dataset for building machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions occurring in e-commerce websites. The original dataset contains all activities of a new user visiting a website, including sign-up time, purchase time, purchase value, ip address, device id, source, age and sex. Most of these activity records do not show patterns modelable by machine learning algorithms, which need either feature transformation or feature extraction for ML to learn and then predict. 

#Background
  
  Transaction in e-commerce websites has high risk of users performing fraudulent activities such as doing money laundry, using stolen identity and credit card, etc. due to unscreened and diversified background of users. The rise in artificial intelligent (machine learning in specific) enables to detect these fraudulent activities with accuracy and real-time. However, the activities and background of a new user visiting a website (called data) are usually not directly learnable by machine learning algorithms. Feature extraction from activity records and feature transformation from user's background are a necessity as well as a prerequisite for building a machine learning model.
    
    In this repo, we have a dataset containing a website selling clothes and the first transaction activities of new users. The users' activity and background are collected when they visited and performed activities at the website. Here the purpose is to build a machine learning model to predict (in real time) whether a new user is performing fraudulent activity. Also, based on model outputs, what kind of users' experience could be recommended to the website.
